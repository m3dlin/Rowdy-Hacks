## Usageüì±ü§≥

Dino Detector is a web application with the purpose of being accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The app allows you to scan barcodes and, if you're lucky, a dinosaur will appear that you can capture. When you capture the dinosaur, you can view it in your inventory. The inventory showcases all the dinosaurs you have thus far. There is also a Dinopedia page to learn more about the dinosaurs and their traits.

The website is currently hosted on render at [https://rowdy-hacks.onrender.com](https://rowdy-hacks.onrender.com)
